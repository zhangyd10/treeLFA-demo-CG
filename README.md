# treeLFA-demo
A demonstration of using treeLFA to infer topics of disease codes from a simulated diagnosis data is in the R Markdown file named "docs/treeLFA-demo.Rmd".

To download treeLFA-demo, use the command:

git clone https://github.com/zhangyd10/treeLFA-demo-CG.git


【Update 2023-10-06】
A Variational Bayes inference algorithm for treeLFA is in development and being tested (https://github.com/Xilin-Jiang/ATM#gwas-using-latent-feature-allocation-lfa), and will soon be available. The new inference algorithm is expected to significantly speed up the inference of treeLFA and facilitate its use on large dataset.
